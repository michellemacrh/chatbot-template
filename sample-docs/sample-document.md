# Sample Document

This is a sample document to demonstrate the format for training data in the RAG system.

## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with relevant information retrieved from a knowledge base. This allows the model to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## How RAG Works

1. **Indexing**: Documents are broken into chunks and converted into vector embeddings.
2. **Retrieval**: When a query is received, the system finds the most relevant chunks.
3. **Generation**: The retrieved chunks are provided as context to the LLM, which generates a response.

## Benefits of RAG

- **Accuracy**: Provides factual information from trusted sources
- **Up-to-date information**: Can be updated with new documents
- **Reduced hallucinations**: Grounds the model's responses in actual data
- **Domain specificity**: Can be tailored to specific domains or topics

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how you might use a RAG-based chatbot:

```
User: What are the system requirements for installation?

Chatbot: Based on our documentation, the system requirements for installation are:

1. Operating System: Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)
2. CPU: Quad-core processor, 2.5 GHz or higher
3. RAM: 8 GB minimum, 16 GB recommended
4. Storage: 10 GB of free disk space
5. Internet connection for initial setup and updates

For optimal performance, we recommend using an SSD rather than an HDD.
```

## Document Formatting Tips

When creating documents for the RAG system, follow these guidelines:

### Use Clear Headings

Structure your documents with clear headings and subheadings to help with chunking and retrieval.

### Include Metadata

Use YAML front matter at the top of each document to provide metadata:

```yaml
---
title: "Document Title"
description: "Brief description"
category: "category-name"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
created: "2023-07-01"
updated: "2023-07-01"
---
```

### Be Specific

The more specific and clear your documents are, the better the chatbot will be able to retrieve relevant information.

### Use Examples

Include concrete examples to help the model understand the context better.

## Conclusion

This sample document demonstrates the recommended format for training data in the RAG system. By following these guidelines, you can create effective documents that will help the chatbot provide accurate and helpful responses.
