# Evaluating and Improving Chatbot Performance

This guide provides methods for assessing your RAG chatbot's performance and strategies for improving its accuracy, relevance, and overall usefulness for your team.

## Evaluation Methods

### 1. Question-Answer Testing

Create a test set of questions and expected answers based on your documentation:

1. Compile 20-30 representative questions your team might ask
2. Document where in your knowledge base the answer should come from
3. Run these questions through your chatbot
4. Compare the chatbot's answers with the expected information

Example test case:
```
Question: "What's the process for requesting access to the production database?"
Expected Source: team-processes/access-requests.md
Expected Information: Should mention the access request form, approval from the database admin, and 2-day waiting period
```

### 2. Relevance Assessment

Evaluate whether the retrieved documents are relevant to the questions:

1. Enable debug mode to see which document chunks are being retrieved
2. For each question, assess if the top retrieved chunks are truly relevant
3. Calculate a relevance score: (number of relevant chunks) / (total chunks retrieved)

### 3. User Feedback Collection

Gather structured feedback from actual users:

1. After each response, ask users to rate the answer (1-5 stars)
2. Provide a way for users to indicate if information is missing or incorrect
3. Periodically review this feedback to identify patterns

### 4. Hallucination Detection

Check if the chatbot is "hallucinating" information not in your documents:

1. Ask questions on topics not covered in your documentation
2. The ideal response should indicate that the information isn't available
3. Flag any responses that confidently provide information not in your docs

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Irrelevant Retrieval

**Symptoms**:
- Chatbot retrieves document chunks unrelated to the question
- Answers contain information from the wrong topics

**Solutions**:
1. **Improve Chunking Strategy**:
   - Adjust chunk size (smaller for precise retrieval, larger for more context)
   - Modify chunk overlap to prevent splitting related information

2. **Enhance Embedding Quality**:
   - Try a different embedding model with better semantic understanding
   - Update to the latest version of your current embedding model

3. **Refine Documentation**:
   - Break up large documents into more focused topics
   - Improve document titles and headings to be more specific

### Issue: Missing Information

**Symptoms**:
- Chatbot fails to find relevant information that exists in your docs
- Responses are incomplete compared to available documentation

**Solutions**:
1. **Expand Retrieval Window**:
   - Increase the number of chunks retrieved (TOP_K in config.py)
   - Adjust similarity threshold if you're using one

2. **Improve Documentation Coverage**:
   - Add missing information to your documentation
   - Ensure important information appears in multiple relevant contexts

3. **Enhance Question Processing**:
   - Implement query expansion to include synonyms or related terms
   - Add examples of different ways to ask for the same information

### Issue: Hallucination

**Symptoms**:
- Chatbot confidently provides incorrect information
- Responses include details not present in your documentation

**Solutions**:
1. **Adjust LLM Parameters**:
   - Lower the temperature setting (e.g., 0.1 instead of 0.7)
   - Increase the "presence penalty" to discourage making things up

2. **Improve Prompting**:
   - Modify the system prompt to emphasize factual accuracy
   - Explicitly instruct the model to say "I don't know" when uncertain

3. **Enhance Context Instructions**:
   - Add explicit instructions to only use provided context
   - Include a reminder about the limitations of the knowledge base

### Issue: Poor Response Formatting

**Symptoms**:
- Responses are poorly structured or hard to read
- Code examples or tables are not formatted correctly

**Solutions**:
1. **Improve Prompt Engineering**:
   - Specify desired output format in the system prompt
   - Include examples of well-formatted responses

2. **Enhance Documentation Formatting**:
   - Ensure your source documents use consistent markdown formatting
   - Use proper code blocks, tables, and lists in your documentation

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### 1. Hybrid Retrieval

Combine different retrieval methods:

1. **Keyword + Semantic Search**:
   - Use both keyword matching and semantic similarity
   - Weight results from both approaches

2. **Multi-stage Retrieval**:
   - First pass: broad retrieval with high recall
   - Second pass: re-rank results for precision

### 2. Query Transformation

Improve queries before retrieval:

1. **Query Expansion**:
   - Add synonyms or related terms to the query
   - Expand acronyms automatically

2. **Query Decomposition**:
   - Break complex questions into simpler sub-questions
   - Retrieve information for each sub-question

### 3. Custom Chunking Strategies

Develop more sophisticated chunking approaches:

1. **Semantic Chunking**:
   - Chunk based on semantic boundaries rather than just character count
   - Keep related concepts together

2. **Hierarchical Chunking**:
   - Create chunks at different levels of granularity
   - Use different chunk sizes for different document types

### 4. Fine-tuning

If you have the resources, consider fine-tuning:

1. **Embedding Model Fine-tuning**:
   - Fine-tune the embedding model on your specific documentation
   - Improve semantic understanding of your domain-specific terms

2. **LLM Fine-tuning**:
   - Create a dataset of questions and ideal answers from your docs
   - Fine-tune the LLM to better handle your specific use cases

## Measuring Improvement

Track these metrics over time to measure improvement:

1. **Retrieval Precision**:
   - Percentage of retrieved chunks that are relevant

2. **Retrieval Recall**:
   - Percentage of relevant chunks that are successfully retrieved

3. **Answer Accuracy**:
   - Percentage of questions answered correctly according to your docs

4. **User Satisfaction**:
   - Average user rating of responses
   - Percentage of queries that receive positive feedback

5. **Hallucination Rate**:
   - Percentage of responses containing information not in your docs

## Creating a Feedback Loop

Establish a continuous improvement process:

1. **Collect Data**:
   - Log all questions asked
   - Record which documents were retrieved
   - Save user feedback

2. **Analyze Patterns**:
   - Identify common questions with poor answers
   - Find topics where information is frequently missing
   - Detect patterns in hallucinations

3. **Prioritize Improvements**:
   - Focus on high-impact, frequently asked questions
   - Address systematic issues before edge cases

4. **Implement Changes**:
   - Update documentation based on findings
   - Adjust configuration parameters
   - Enhance prompts or chunking strategies

5. **Measure Results**:
   - Compare performance before and after changes
   - Ensure improvements don't cause regressions

## Note to the Reader

The quality of your documentation is the foundation of a successful RAG chatbot. Often, the most effective way to improve performance is to enhance the underlying documentation based on the patterns you observe in chatbot usage.
